# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

## Overview

   The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.
   Data required for the project can be found at https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

## Project Summary
   A file named run_analysis.R is created which does the following - 
   1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
   2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
   3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
   4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
   5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
    Additonal information can be found at the CodeBook.md file which includes the list of variables, the information about the data and any transformation or work required to cleanup the data in this project.
